# TESLCardBot
TESLCardBot is a Reddit bot that will fetch info about cards from _The Elder Scrolls: Legends_.

It defaults to /r/elderscrollslegends, but can be ran on any subreddit. It is summoned by enclosing a card's name in double brackets, like this: `{{Blood Dragon}}`.

The files _Procfile_ and _runtime.txt_ are required by [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), the platform this bot runs on.
