# TESLCardBot
TESLCardBot is a Reddit bot whose purpose is to ~~pass butter~~ look for threads and comments mentioning *The Elder Scrolls: Legends* cards on /r/elderscrollslegends and to reply providing information about those cards.
You can summon it by enclosing a card's name in brackets in your comment, {{Like This}}.

The files _Procfile_ and _runtime.txt_ are required by [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), the platform this bot runs on.
